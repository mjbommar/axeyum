//! The SMT-LIB text front door (ADR-0018).
//!
//! [`solve_smtlib`] is the entry point a real SMT consumer reaches for: it takes
//! a script as *text* — a file, an editor buffer, output from another tool —
//! parses it with [`axeyum_smtlib`], and decides it with [`crate::solve`]. The
//! whole path is text in, a checked `sat`/`unsat`/`unknown` out.
//!
//! The script's declared `(set-info :status ...)` is passed through unchanged in
//! [`SmtLibOutcome::expected_status`]; it is *not* consulted when solving, so a
//! caller can cross-check the decision against the benchmark's own ground truth.
//! The trust anchor stays exactly where it is in [`crate::solve`]: a `sat` model
//! is replayed against the original term through the ground evaluator.
