# Formal Mathematics Tour — Curriculum Knowledge Graph

A structured, machine-readable curriculum for a *formal* tour of mathematics,
derived by working **backward** from three destinations — calculus, number
theory, and linear algebra — to their foundational prerequisites. It exists to
serve axeyum's double-duty thesis
([ADR-0033](../research/09-decisions/adr-0033-double-duty-educational-artifacts.md)):
the same artifacts that teach a concept also test an axeyum theory.

- **🎓 K-12 layer (the school-facing front door):** [`k12/`](k12/README.md) —
  the same backbone projected onto grade bands and a single integrated pedagogy
  (**logic + reasoning + math + computer science as one subject**, with axeyum as
  the self-checking auto-grader). Start with the
  [K-12 vision](k12/README.md), the [four strands](k12/strands.md), and the worked
  modules ([binary & wraparound](k12/modules/binary-and-wraparound.md),
  [truth & counterexamples](k12/modules/truth-and-counterexamples.md)).
- **The graph:** [`curriculum.toml`](curriculum.toml) is the authoritative
  node/edge list (prerequisites = edges) plus per-node decidability/testability
  metadata. The `axeyum-scenarios::mathtour` module mirrors it and a test fails
  if they drift.
- **The prose:** one markdown file per node, organized by layer (below). Each
  follows the same template (summary · role · prerequisites/unlocks · *testable
  in axeyum* · Lean-horizon · references).
- **The design rationale:** the
  [formal-mathematics-tour note](../research/08-planning/formal-mathematics-tour.md).
- **The scope ceiling (read this):** [DEPTH.md](DEPTH.md) — what `covered` does
  and does *not* mean (map vs. textbook depth; the decidability ceiling).
- **Canonical texts mapped:** [foundational-books/](foundational-books/README.md)
  — how Spivak and others project onto the LRA / NRA / Lean-horizon split.
- **What to build next:** [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) — the prioritized 10–20-item
  build list, by yield × readiness.
- **Lean-horizon targets:** [reconstruction-targets/](reconstruction-targets/README.md)
  — `∀`-theorems (Peano induction) frozen as proof-track goals, not benchmarks.

## How to read this

The graph is a DAG; a *teaching order* is any topological sort of it. Read
bottom-up (foundations first) to build, or top-down from a destination to see
what it presupposes. Every node names the **decidable/computable fragment**
axeyum can self-check — that fragment is the testable, benchmarkable content;
the rest is flagged Lean-horizon.

### Decidability legend

| Class | Meaning | axeyum handling |
|---|---|---|
| `decidable` | a complete decision procedure exists | self-checked end to end |
| `computable` | the answer is computed, then independently checked | compute-and-verify / witness |
| `bounded` | only finite/fixed instances are decided | exhaustive/sampled, marked |
| `undecidable` | the general case is proof-assistant territory | **Lean-horizon**, never a benchmark |

### Status legend

`covered` — has a self-checking exercise family today · `planned` — testable
fragment identified, family not yet built · `lean-horizon` — primarily a
proof-reconstruction target (P3.6/P3.7), not a benchmark.

## Why this doubles as testing coverage

The testable fragment of each node maps onto an axeyum arithmetic theory:
number theory → BV/LIA (decided today), linear algebra → LRA/NRA, calculus →
NRA. Building the curriculum's self-checking exercises therefore *also* grows the
comprehensive corpora those theories need — most pointedly NRA, which the
[example-suites note](../research/08-planning/foundational-example-suites.md) and
P2.5 record as lacking one.
