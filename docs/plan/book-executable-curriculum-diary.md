# Executable textbook curriculum diary

This is the chronological engineering record for the Axeyum machinery behind
*Instruction Sets, Programs, and Proofs*. It records what was attempted, what
failed, what the controls established, and what remains unavailable. The
capability claims in `PLAN.md` and the book must stay narrower than this diary:
an entry records work; only replayable gates establish support.

## 2026-08-30 — repository audit and semantic boundary

The book inventory contained definitions and open obligations, but no active
machine-proof evidence rows. The four `CandidateLanguage`, `EvidenceManifest`,
and lesson-interface listings were explicitly illustrative. Axeyum provided
IR, solver, evidence, and Python foundations but no instruction-set semantic
authority. Starting with Python or a solver formula would therefore create a
second, ungrounded meaning for the machine examples.

Decision ADR-0811 creates `axeyum-machine` as a dependency-light Rust boundary:
concrete machine behavior first, formulas and certificates second, faithful
Python projection last. This also preserves ADR-0545's rule that Python may
project implemented Rust operations but may not invent them.

## 2026-08-30 — A0 concrete execution, first complete pass

Implemented the canonical A0 contract from the companion book:

- modular words at widths 8, 16, ..., 64, with signed and unsigned readings;
- little-endian split/join and finite byte-addressed data memory;
- eight general registers, Z/N/C/V conditions, modular PC, and explicit
  running, halted, and trapped outcomes;
- immutable code, four-byte fetch, strict decode, and every specified opcode;
- addition carry/overflow and subtraction no-borrow/overflow;
- logical and arithmetic shifts, compare, all eight branch predicates, jump,
  halt, precise fetch/data/encoding traps, and bounded state traces.

The first Clippy pass found 24 conversion, documentation, and expression-shape
problems. They were repaired without relaxing `-D warnings`. Nine initial
semantic tests passed, but that was too shallow to call the model complete.

The expanded suite found three bad test encodings/expectations, not semantic
implementation faults: the test's `rs1` field selected r2 instead of r1, its
left-shift expected value was wrong, and its subtraction carry expected borrow
rather than A0's declared no-borrow convention. Each control was corrected.

The expansion also found a real implementation omission. Code fetch subtracted
base addresses in host `u64` arithmetic, so a valid code image crossing the top
of an 8-bit address space could not fetch after PC wrap. Fetch now reduces the
offset at the architectural word width. A regression executes a jump at 252,
wraps to 0, fetches the following halt, and stops normally.

Current focused evidence:

```text
AXEYUM_AGENT=book-executable scripts/cargo-serialized.sh clippy \
  -p axeyum-machine --all-targets -- -D warnings
PASS

AXEYUM_AGENT=book-executable scripts/cargo-serialized.sh test \
  -p axeyum-machine
PASS: 17 integration tests, including exhaustive 8-bit add/sub flags
```

The suite covers every opcode family, every branch predicate with a taken and
untaken control, all supported immediate widths, zero and nonzero shifts,
unaligned 16-bit little-endian memory, incomplete/misaligned fetch, modular
code wrap, illegal/reserved encodings, finite-range stores without partial
writes, and terminal-state stuttering.

## Next boundary

A0 concrete execution alone does **not** establish a machine proof. The next
slice must add an independently checkable A0 observation/relation layer and a
derived QF_BV proof route with a mutation control. Only after that route emits
and replays evidence should the book mark its A0 proof obligations implemented.
RV64 and x86-64 remain unavailable until their authoritative source revisions,
supported instruction forms, decode constraints, and differential controls are
pinned and implemented.
