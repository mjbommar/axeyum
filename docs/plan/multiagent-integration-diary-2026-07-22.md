# Multi-Agent Integration Diary — 2026-07-22

Integrator's running log for the three concurrent codex lanes. One entry per
review/integration cycle. Operating discipline: **read-only on agent lanes**,
green-before-merge gate, one integrator owns `main`
(`~/projects/personal/axeyum`). See
[`../contributor-guide/multi-agent-operations.md`](../contributor-guide/multi-agent-operations.md).

## The long-term vision (the compass for every merge decision)

> **lean/z3/cvc5 + Mathematica/sympy = axeyum** — a *proof-carrying* solver +
> CAS. Every result is certified or it DECLINES; soundness is never traded for
> coverage. Parity is measured against z3/cvc5 (SMT, quantifiers, the hard
> `QF_*` subset) and SymPy/Mathematica (CAS).

The three lanes are the three legs of that goal:

| Lane | Branch | Worktree | Leg of the vision |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lean** | `agent/lean/nested-inductive-elimination` | `~/projects/personal/axeyum-lean-nested` | trusted kernel / proof import (the "lean" leg) |
| **SMT-COMP** | `agent/smtcomp/full-library-resume` | `~/projects/personal/axeyum-smtcomp` | solver parity vs z3/cvc5 on SMT-LIB (`QF_*` + quantifiers) |
| **CAS** | `agent/cas/vandermonde-wz` | `/nas4/.../claude-axeyum-cas-work` | SymPy/Mathematica parity (Vandermonde `∑C(n,k)²=C(2n,n)` next) |

## Integration process (each trigger)

1. Refresh refs; per-lane digest (commits, files-vs-main, in-memory merge preview, health).
2. Review each new commit's *diff* — scope (in-lane files only?), soundness, tests.
3. Green gate on a tree I own (warm target): `cargo test -p <crate>` for the
   changed crate + `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` for semantic-merge safety.
4. Merge only if green + conflict-clean; ff when possible. Push. Reset-on-red before any push.
5. Log micro (what each lane did) + macro (cumulative parity picture) here.

## Parity tracker (updated as lanes land; researched vs upstream)

| Front | axeyum today | Upstream ref | Gap being worked |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lean kernel import | nested-inductive **declines cleanly** (M1 done) | Lean 4 kernel | admit nested inductives (TL2.14) |
| SMT `QF_*` | (baseline TBD this session) | z3 / cvc5 SMT-COMP | full-library resume run |
| CAS summation | Gosper + WZ (`∑C(n,k)`, `∑k·C(n,k)`, `∑k²·C(n,k)`) | SymPy `Sum`, Mathematica | Vandermonde squared-Γ ratio |

## Cycle log

### Cycle 1 — 2026-07-22 (~10:48 EDT) — trigger: Lean commit

**Micro.**
- **Lean** — merged `48fece10..99ec3e3e` (2 commits): `893afc1f fix(lean-import):
  classify nested recursor exports` + `99ec3e3e docs: close Lean nested-inductive M1`.
  The fix moves nested detection *before* admission and gates on a structurally
  derived `numNested` (recursor count == families + nested, else typed decline),
  reclassifying nested exports from `Malformed/message` → `Unsupported/code`
  (a cleaner "we DECLINE this" signal — right on the soundness compass).
  Scope: code only in `axeyum-lean-import`; rest docs + PLAN/STATUS.
  **Gate: GREEN** — `cargo test -p axeyum-lean-import` all pass; `cargo check
  --workspace --all-targets` exit 0. **Merged (ff) → main `99ec3e3e`, pushed.**
- **SMT-COMP** — 3 uncommitted files in tree, no commit yet. Warming up.
- **CAS** — 2 uncommitted files (the `vandermonde-wz` task), no commit yet.

**Macro.** Lean's leg advances from "nested inductives were an ad-hoc malformed
error" to "nested inductives are a *typed, tested, structural decline* (M1
closed)" — the correct pre-condition before actually admitting them (TL2.14).
This is the proof-carrying discipline working: decline precisely, then extend.

**Health.** `/tmp` 80% (doctest-link quota watch — TMPDIR isolation in use);
`/nas4` 61%; no solver runaways; 28 °C. All green.

**Watch-items.** Lean edited shared `PLAN.md`/`STATUS.md`; if CAS/SMT touch them
too, expect doc-level merge conflicts — resolve by union, never clobber a lane's lines.
