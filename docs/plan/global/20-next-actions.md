## Next Actions

Work in this order unless new evidence reveals a wrong verdict, crash, data-loss
risk, or invalid gate. Those are P0 and preempt the queue.

The ordered ten-item programme remains A2 through A11. A1 and A2 are retained
here as closed evidence boundaries. A3 remains incomplete, but all currently
preregistered bounded mechanisms are closed negatively. A4 has now also yielded;
A5 is the first active item.

<!-- plan-generated: lane-status -->

### A1 — Complete arithmetic deadline and resource enforcement (`DONE`, P0)

Shared deadlines, CAD cancellation, deterministic LRA normalization ceilings,
the DL fallback-reservation repair, exact resume identity, six fresh retained
division runs, and their ledger commits are complete. See the closure note
linked above. The one QF_LIA whole-sweep miss is retained honestly and bounded
by a 3/3 isolated UNSAT reproduction well inside the protocol budget.

### A2 — Rebase and finish credited full-library readiness (`DONE`, P0)

**Why now.** Eleven division samples are useful, but representative general
solving-power remains unmeasured. The topic branch
`agent/smtcomp/full-preparation-live` contains substantial process-free work
based on older July state and must not be merged or launched as-is.

**Completed checkpoint.** The branch audit and R1--R5 process-free topic are
complete. R5 is implemented at `e4bb854bf` with 52 focused tests / 82 subtests,
165 aggregate tests, scoped gates, and a successful real locked/offline build
smoke. Exact topic `2925efea5` was pushed, matched its remote, and passed one
uninterrupted R3-isolated `just check`. Integration review proved the topic was
strictly ahead with no divergence and previewed a conflict-free merge. Merge
`8ed5ad089` then passed the focused post-merge gates and the full combined-main
`just check` with external frontier artifacts and a clean tracked tree. The
exact disposition and gate separation are in the dated A2 audit and R5
implementation result.

**Next slice.** None in A2. Preserve the integrated process-free contract and
move to A3. Do not execute the constructed live operator merely because its
process-free and integration gates are green.

**Exit.** Current-main identity is immutable, readiness and resume gates are
green, the published root is process-free with `launch_authorized=false`, and
an independently reviewed later step authorizes any bounded live execution.

**Stop.** No host/NAS mutation or solver launch from stale refs, red gates, or
an unaccepted root. Follow
[`docs/plan/smtcomp-full-library-workstream/README.md`](docs/plan/smtcomp-full-library-workstream/README.md).

### A3 — Re-certify and deepen QF_NIA (`WIP`, P1)

**Why now.** The current clean entry is 34/200 versus 89/200 (38.2%), a material
gain over the former 21-decision entry but still the weakest retained arithmetic
ratio. Twelve Axeyum-only decisions also make replay and causal classification
important, not just score growth.

**Completed checkpoint.** The exact 67-row causal census and 13-row diagnostic
are retained. Giant `distinct` expansion is bounded and typed. Model
reconstruction no longer erases oracle declines or fabricates a default model.
Probe-model reuse failed its seven-target retention gate and its temporary code
was removed. Focused SMT-LIB, solver, explanation, DPLL, NIA-linearization,
route-trace, integration, Clippy, docs, and link gates are green. One aggregate attempt found the
load-sensitive coupling deadline; the repaired attempt passed all code, solver,
frontier, CAS, rustdoc, resource, policy, resume, and Lean suites but found a
one-field stale generated CI-workflow identity at final parity-docs. Both defects
are repaired. Exact topic `3586c41d9` passed one uninterrupted external-frontier
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 just check` with exit 0 and a clean tracked tree. Topic push,
merge `0c31baf97`, and combined-main `just check` are complete and green.
Exact-SHA docs run `31190516093` and CI run `31190517748` are terminal failures
at the registered-`just` path lookup, while every non-doc CI job is green.
Repair `259797459` is integrated at `bd413357c`; exact-SHA docs run
`31192792512` and CI run `31192792245` are terminal green. This remote gate is
separate from the green solver gates.
The reconstruction-deadline diagnostic then measured both targets with
size-inadmissible dense Gomory and zero B&B nodes after deadline expiry. Its
follow-up root-repair discriminator was route-unstable under host contention,
so the cluster was rejected and every temporary solver edit removed. See the
[`v1 result`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-reconstruction-deadline-cluster-v1-result-2026-08-07.md).
The next cluster confirmed repeated size-admission broad cores on `SAT14/1051`
(3/3) and `SAT14/1280` (2/3). Its preregistered four-group deletion mechanism
made clauses narrower but spent up to four extra exact-theory calls per
conflict, moved both budget stops earlier, and decided neither target. The
implementation was rejected and fully removed. See the
[`large-core v1 result`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-large-core-cluster-v1-result-2026-08-07.md)
and
[`group-deletion v2 result`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-large-core-group-deletion-v2-result-2026-08-07.md).

The cheaper
[`relevance-activated bound-ladder experiment`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-relevant-bound-ladders-v1-result-2026-08-07.md)
then activated hundreds of checked adjacent implications without an additional
theory-oracle call, but all six target observations remained `unknown`. Its
target gate failed, controls and aggregate runs were not authorized, and all
temporary solver code was removed. The resulting
[`typed-budget partition`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-budget-partition-v1-result-2026-08-07.md)
classifies all 52 deferred rows as 37 mixed width timeouts, 11 all-SAT
pre-lowering estimate refusals, three UNSAT combined-theory timeouts, and one
UNSAT replay-detected model overflow. Fresh current-baseline traces show the
four-row UNSAT tail is downstream of the owning exact-search stop and cannot be
recovered soundly by the SAT-only width ladder.

**Next slice.** None is currently evidence-authorized. The v1/v2
[`clause-estimate result`](docs/plan/qf-nia-a3-clause-estimate-attribution-v2-result-2026-08-07.md)
closed the final selected route at its complete-record gate without changing
production code. Preserve the 34/200 ledger, every negative control, the
64,000,000 pre-allocation ceiling, and original-term replay, then move to A4.
Resume A3 only when independent new evidence identifies a bounded mechanism;
do not revive probe-model reuse, reconstruction reservation, group deletion,
relevance ladders, or fresh-parse clause attribution, and do not raise general
caps.

**Exit.** One preregistered cluster improves a fresh whole-list result without
losing any of the 34 decisions; all SAT answers replay on the original terms and
the ledger remains disagreement-free.

**Stop.** Do not optimize on the 12 Axeyum-only cases as if they were reference
failures, and do not raise general caps to convert time into apparent breadth.

### A4 — Deepen QF_UFLIA combination (`WIP`, yielded, P1)

**Why now.** QF_UFLIA is 94/180 (52.2%) with zero Axeyum-only decisions and 86
reference-only cases, making it the clearest combined-theory depth gap.

**Next slice.** None is evidence-authorized. The theory-model reuse result
stopped negatively; revisit only with deterministic-work evidence for the
conjunctive LIA probe. The 26 wide-integer rows remain ADR-0376 controls.

**Exit.** One preregistered, replay-checked cluster improves the clean full-list
result without losing any of the 94 decisions or weakening retained controls.

**Stop.** No general cap increase, speculative recursive MBQI, or unchecked SAT
model credit.

### A5 — Consolidate linear arithmetic after warm simplex and DL (`WIP`, P1)

**Why now.** QF_LRA, QF_IDL, and QF_RDL improved sharply but remain strict
subsets of their references. The newest architecture has not yet received one
cross-division residual census.

**Next slice.** Restart and derive the complete V2 census from the fully gated
classifier repair. Only after a zero-loss
derivation may normalization failures,
unsupported difference shapes, disequalities, explanation blowups, and
ordinary search failures be classified across the three current ledgers. Treat
the repaired high-memory LRA normalization case and the rejected global 12/12
DL split as permanent controls before adding new DL syntax. The
[`v2 cross-division census preregistration`](docs/plan/qf-linear-a5-cross-division-census-v2-preregistration-2026-08-09.md)
freezes all three populations and historical sidecars, makes all 259 retained
decisions monotonicity controls, and authorizes only fresh current-Axeyum traces
plus lossless derivation. No production change is yet authorized.

**Exit.** A/B measurement is monotone across all three divisions, exact
Farkas/DL evidence checks pass, deep input returns without recursion abort, and
the retained arithmetic fuzz suites execute nonzero cases.

### A6 — Close proof-production errors and evidence gaps (`TODO`, P1)

**Why now.** Definitive answers without checkable evidence violate the product's
core direction even when verdicts are sound.

**Next slice.** Fix the two QF_NIA `IntPow2` production errors first. Then use
route provenance—not query syntax alone—to split the 38 QF_BV bare UNSAT rows
and the broader arithmetic/string-sequence proof gaps.

**Exit.** Zero production errors; every newly credited certificate passes its
own independent checker; text-only recheck, arena-backed check, Lean
reconstruction, and bare-result counts remain separate fields.

**Stop.** Never relabel arena-backed checking as serialized proof replay or
generate proof credit through query-only re-derivation.

### A7 — Finish route observability before searched policy (`TODO`, P1)

**Why now.** `RouteTrace::to_json` landed, but the bench path and quantifier
preamble are incomplete. The proposed exploration tracker also incorrectly
placed T3.5 before its own G1 phase-3 gate.

**Required order.** Accept or revise the blocking ADRs; complete T0.2 route
registry; complete T0.6 recorder sites and `solve_explained`; finish T0.1 bench
persistence; add T2.5 public-corpus coverage; run T2.3/G1; only then consider
T3.5 policy-v0 equivalence.

**Exit.** Every registered route has a stable ID, the representative corpus
covers the catalogue or records explicit gaps, legacy dispatch replays exactly,
and G1—not enthusiasm—decides whether searched policy proceeds.

**Stop.** The exploration track remains proposed and may not preempt A2–A6.
See [`docs/plan/exploration-track/`](docs/plan/exploration-track/README.md).

### A8 — Implement SMT-LIB ordered command/event capture (`TODO`, P2)

**Why now.** The checked conformance matrix has six absent command families,
seven accepted no-ops, and zero interactive textual-session rows.

**Next slice.** Accept or revise ADR-0342, then implement S1 capture-only ordered
command/event IR with scoped declarations/definitions, reset epochs, exact query
snapshots, immediate options, and atomic continued errors before rendering.

**Exit.** The registered 14 invariants and 20 fixtures/107 commands pass through
the product path; malformed commands cannot partially mutate session state.

**Stop.** Do not add isolated output helpers and call them textual conformance.

### A9 — Restore official Lean execution and shrink the prelude (`TODO`, P2)

**Why now.** The local host currently has neither `lean` nor `elan`; remote
70/70 attestation remains open; seven ledger rows are already classified as
derivable theorems.

**Next slice.** Provision the checksum-pinned Lean 4.30 executable, prove it
runs outside the repository working directory, obtain the remote 70/70 result,
then replace the seven derivable axioms with theorem terms in dependency order.

**Exit.** Kernel tests, official Lean, generated ledger counts, declaration
order, parity docs, and mutation controls all pass; no hard-coded old count
survives.

**Stop.** Do not widen into String literals, quotient computation, or broad
ecosystem claims during this bounded trust-reduction slice.

### A10 — Build the SMT-LIB product surface after S1 (`TODO`, P2)

**Why now.** Production replacement requires more than solver depth. Once A8
freezes session semantics, add canonical response rendering and the missing
command families in dependency order.

**Next slice.** Use the generated conformance matrix to choose the first absent
family whose semantics and reset/scoping behavior are already representable.

**Exit.** End-to-end textual fixtures compare ordered outputs and state changes,
errors remain atomic, and API helpers and text mode share one semantic core.

### A11 — Make worktree and build-cache retirement routine (`WIP`, P2)

**Why now.** Accumulated per-worktree Cargo targets and the agent-target cache
filled the filesystem until a valid post-merge build failed at 585 MiB free.
The bounded cleanup recovered about 885 GiB without deleting dirty or unmerged
work, but the same failure will recur without a documented retention loop.

**Next slice.** Add a read-only inventory command or script that reports each
worktree's branch, dirty/merged state, target size, last activity, and safe
cleanup classification. Document an operator procedure that uses `cargo clean`
before worktree removal and requires explicit review for every dirty, unmerged,
detached, or cache-tag-missing path.

**Completed checkpoint.** The manual bounded cleanup and post-A3 retirement
proved the safety procedure for clean merged worktrees and reproducible Cargo
targets. The later authorized cleanup salvaged inactive dirty deltas, removed
the inactive checkouts, and retired the merged A3 targets. On 2026-08-12 all
refs were captured in a verified external Git bundle before old local/remote
branches and salvage stashes were removed. Only clean `main` is registered and
published. Automation and fixture coverage remain open.

**Exit.** The inventory is deterministic and tested against dirty, merged,
unmerged, detached, missing-target, and malformed-cache fixtures. A dry run
identifies disposable bytes without mutation; cleanup requires explicit exact
targets and preserves branches and live work.

**Stop.** Never recursively delete a worktree root, infer safety from age alone,
or remove dirty/unmerged state to meet a free-space target.
