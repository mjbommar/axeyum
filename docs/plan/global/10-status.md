## Status

**A5 repair history.** Fail-closed LRA/IDL restarts exposed wide-core and
first-solve allocation growth, mixed-numeric parsing, native recursion,
unhonored construction deadlines, and declaration-scale quadratic work. Their
pushed bounded/iterative repairs and every non-credited partial stream are
retained in the
[failure/repair record](docs/plan/qf-linear-a5-wide-core-memory-repair-2026-08-08.md);
the current release returns typed `unknown` on each former abort trigger.

Axeyum is a working research-grade automated-reasoning stack with a pure-Rust
default path, replay-checked SAT models, multiple independently checked UNSAT
evidence routes, broad but uneven theory support, an independent Lean-core
checker/importer, and several consumers. It is not yet a drop-in Z3 replacement
or a replacement for the Lean system.

The [Lean requirements](docs/plan/lean-kernel-requirements-2026-08-13.md) are
**WIP**. Nat is zero-axiom; Int reconstruction remains assumption-bearing.

Exact pushed repairs for the A5 (linear-arithmetic), A3 (string/integer) and
A2 (stale-branch) streams — commit-by-commit, with the non-credited partial
streams retained — are in the
[A5/A3/A2 repair journal](docs/plan/a5-a3-repair-journal-2026-08.md). The
current release returns typed `unknown` on each former abort trigger; A3 yields
to A4.

### A1 arithmetic resource closure

A1 is **DONE**. Resource increment `96ff85930` (merge `14f80a2bf`) resolves the
two measured arithmetic resource defects:

1. ADR-0377 makes arithmetic timeout query-global across sequential exact-real,
   NRA, real-relaxation, NIA-linearization, bounded-blast, and width-ladder
   routes. The same absolute deadline is polled inside solver-local CAD
   polynomial, projection, determinant, exact-division, and rational-cell loops.
   The public QF_NIA `ext-rew-aggr-test` now returns `Unknown(Timeout)` in 0.30 s
   for a 250 ms optimized request instead of 1.10 s; a committed debug regression
   finishes in 0.28 s and requires less than 1 s.
2. Online LRA normalization now has deterministic node, coefficient-work, and
   retained-cache ceilings. Production entry points distinguish deadline expiry
   from resource exhaustion and return `Unknown(Timeout)` or
   `Unknown(ResourceLimit)` rather than constructing a partial theory. The
   existing 1,024-atom front-door cap remains; current `sc-39.base.cvc.smt2`
   declines in 0.10 s at roughly 13 MiB instead of reproducing the historical
   8 GiB abort seen when that cap was experimentally raised.

Focused resource gates are green: deadline 6/6, online-LRA 7/7, CAD 37/37, the
normalization exhausted/near-miss unit, full all-feature solver Clippy, format,
and documentation links. The terminal aggregate solver gate
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo test -p axeyum-solver --all-features --quiet --
--test-threads=2` passed 1,073 library tests and every integration/doctest bin,
including the 397.85-second UFLIA and 286.00-second word-equation differential
tests. `just parity-docs` is independently green at 35 rows, 24 logics, 992
files, 762 decided, 674 oracle-compared, and zero disagreements; its unrelated,
load-sensitive frontier refresh was discarded.

All six required retained lists were rerun fresh from row 1. Results are QF_NIA
34/200 versus 89, QF_LIA 117/200 versus 140, QF_LRA 86/200 versus 146, QF_RDL
105/200 versus 155, QF_IDL 68/200 versus 124, and QF_UFLIA 94/200 versus 180;
all have zero disagreements. The sole lower whole-sweep decision, one QF_LIA
`ex3000...` UNSAT, reproduced 3/3 in isolation at about 8.1 seconds under the
24-second protocol and is classified as load-sensitive sweep timing, not a
semantic loss. The ledger honestly retains 117.

The QF_IDL run exposed and then closed a real fallback-reservation regression.
Commit `4477f2bb9` bounds every probe-front-end phase and uses a measured 12/12
probe/fallback split only for 128–1,024-atom numeric equality gates; a global
12/12 split was rejected after losing five controls. A 171-case QF_IDL/QF_RDL
A/B was monotone. The final full sweep recovers `lpsat-goal-18.smt2` as UNSAT,
retains the BubbleSort gain, adds one SAT graph case, and has no Axeyum loss.

Commit `5ce07c55e` (merge `8ea6a7cad`) also makes parity resume identity
fail-closed: exact committed-list paths are canonical; ambiguous legacy
basenames, duplicate rows, and population drift are rejected. The six accepted
A1 runs were fresh and non-resumed. Full evidence, sidecar hashes, rejected IDL
policies, and gate separation are retained in
[`docs/plan/arithmetic-a1-retained-result-2026-08-06.md`](docs/plan/arithmetic-a1-retained-result-2026-08-06.md).

Disk cleanup preserved every branch and salvaged dirty inactive-worktree deltas
to labelled Git stashes before retiring their checkouts. Reproducible Cargo
artifacts and empty failed-run directories were removed only after ancestry,
cleanliness, and open-file checks. Only clean `main` remains registered; retained
evidence and unrelated temporary projects were untouched.

### Current evidence snapshot

- The committed regression scoreboard contains **35 baselines across 24 logic
  fragments**: **762/992** files decided, **674** oracle-compared, and **zero
  recorded disagreements**. This is bounded regression evidence, not universal
  soundness or representative SMT-LIB coverage. See
  [`bench-results/SCOREBOARD.md`](bench-results/SCOREBOARD.md).
- The refreshed 4-second frontier artifacts report BV reduction **38**
  (baseline 30), LIA cuts **35** (baseline 26), NIA UNSAT **40** (baseline 40),
  NRA degree **40** (baseline 40), and string bound **40** (baseline 8). These
  are load-sensitive local frontier measurements; they do not raise baselines.
- The append-only head-to-head ledger currently covers **eleven divisions**.
  Its weak measured edges are QF_NIA **34/89 = 38.2%**, QF_UFLIA
  **94/180 = 52.2%**, QF_IDL **68/124 = 54.8%**, QF_LRA
  **86/146 = 58.9%**, and QF_RDL **105/155 = 67.7%**. Every credited entry has
  zero disagreements. Read the latest entry per division in
  [`bench-results/PARITY.md`](bench-results/PARITY.md); never copy an older
  entry merely because it has a higher score.
- QF_BV evidence mode decides 130 UNSAT rows: **92/130 certified**,
  **78/130 rechecked from serialized text alone**, and **92/92 certified rows
  independently checked against a fresh re-parse and term arena**. Neither
  check had a failure. The remaining 38 are bare UNSAT decisions because the
  evidence-producing route could not decide them within 60 seconds.
- The broader evidence audit still records **58 uncertified occurrences**,
  **eight independently checked results without Lean reconstruction**, and
  **two QF_NIA `IntPow2` proof-production errors**. Do not combine these
  denominators with the newer QF_BV-only experiment.
- The current official-source proof-family population has a retained local
  Lean 4.30 result of **70/70 accepted**. A corrected remote attestation and the
  exhaustive tier remain open. Lean language, ecosystem, and complete native
  compatibility remain far beyond the current K0/K1 slices.
- The previous 64,345-file full-library candidate is not a result: it produced
  zero admissible raw shards. Resumable/process-free readiness work exists, but
  a representative current-main run has not been admitted or published.
