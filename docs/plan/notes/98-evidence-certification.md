# Notes: 98-evidence-certification

Detail moved out of [`../status/98-evidence-certification.md`](../status/98-evidence-certification.md) so the
lane-status block stays inside the per-lane ceiling. Nothing here was
deleted; it was moved.

Three measurements drove the day, each a claim that was true in a way that read
as stronger than it was:

- **Ledger.** Settled SMT-route facts test the *verdict* (`… | tail -1` =
  `unsat`) and are blind to certification. 17 of 17 happened to be
  `certified=1`; nothing enforced it. Now gated, with the barber instance as a
  real negative control — genuinely unsat, genuinely uncertified.
- **Lean gate.** Of 74 crosscheck families, **41 hand Lean a structural
  attestation** — an axiom pair it cannot fail on the merits. The gate reported
  one undifferentiated total; it now prints both halves and floors the
  *reasoning* one, because flooring the sum lets reasoning be swapped for
  attestation with the headline unmoved. `qf_bv` was one of the 41: not a defect
  but a **width**, since enumeration beats bit-blasting below ~16 bits.
  `qf_bv_wide` now exercises the real reconstruction (33 theory / 41 attestation).
- **My own claim.** I wired the e-matching route to `Evidence` and shipped
  `certified=1` on evidence whose independent re-check said FAIL. Reverted, then
  fixed properly: the certificate is portable now — instances are rebuilt in the
  checker's arena rather than trusted by `TermId`, and the ground set is rebuilt
  rather than stored. One/two/four instances all `certified=1 arena=ok`.

**Next.** A6's remainder, now scoped: the "38 QF_BV bare-UNSAT rows" are
evidence-production TIMEOUTS (`PARITY.md` 92/130), and the per-file detail is
gitignored — so it is a measurement run, not desk analysis.

**Two standing cautions for anyone quoting these numbers.** `certified=` and Lean
reconstruction are *independent axes* — a fact can be certified with no Lean
module, and 41 of 74 Lean-checked families prove nothing about their proposition
— so the two must never be summed. And `just check` is red independently of this
lane: `check-plan-authority.py` budgets the `PLAN.md` sources at 52 KB and they
were already 57 KB before this lane existed.
