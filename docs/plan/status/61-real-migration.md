# Lane: agent-real-migration — retiring the axiomatized `Real` package

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**The reconstruction context's carrier is now a parameter, and the constructed
reals already satisfy it (`WIP`, agent-real-migration, 2026-08-18).**
`LraReconstructCtx` no longer holds an `ArithPrelude`; it holds a
`RingSignature` — the same 31 field names, so all 158 field reads across
`arithmetic.rs`, `ordered_ring.rs` and `setoid.rs` are unchanged — plus a
`RingEquality` saying *which relation plays the role of equality*. `new()` keeps
its contract and supplies the `Real` package's instance; `try_new()` is the same
without the panic; `with_ring_signature(kernel, sig)` is the seam: a caller
brings its own kernel and names its own carrier.

**The signature is checked, not trusted.** `RingSignature::validate_in` runs five
guards — presence of all 30; the carrier is a `Sort` and its level is *measured*;
the seven operation/relation shapes by `def_eq` against types built from the
signature's own carrier; every law inhabits `Prop`; every `Const` in a law
statement is one of the eight symbols, a propositional connective, or the
signature's declared equality. Each guard is its own function with its own
negative test. **Mutation-verified twice** (before and after the split into
per-guard functions): deleting guard 2, 3, 4 or 5 kills **exactly one** test out
of 1191 and no other; deleting guard 1 kills two, which are its two entry points
(`validate_in` directly, and through `with_ring_signature`) rather than one
shared rejection path.

**Nothing changed today, and that is measured rather than argued.**
`cargo run -q -p axeyum-solver --features full --example ordered_ring_refutation
-- --require-empty` is **byte-identical to the pre-change baseline** (`diff`, all
five fixtures: footprint 0, 39 setoid binders, 30 of 30 non-slot binder types,
0 residual kernel-`Eq` constants). `farkas_over_the_integers` 9/9,
`sos_lean_reconstruct` 14/14, `--lib --features full` 1191/1191, clippy
`-D warnings` clean, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc` clean (that gate
caught three broken intra-doc links nothing else did).

Detail moved to [`../notes/61-real-migration.md`](../notes/61-real-migration.md).

<!-- plan-section: landed-changes -->

| 2026-08-18 | (pending) | `LraReconstructCtx`'s carrier is a parameter: `RingSignature` + `RingEquality` replace the by-value `ArithPrelude`, `with_ring_signature`/`try_new` replace the panicking constructor, and five mutation-verified guards check a signature against the kernel. `CReal` passes them today with `CReal.Equiv` in the equality slot. Baseline output byte-identical. |
