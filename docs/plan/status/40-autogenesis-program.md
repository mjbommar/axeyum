# Lane: autogenesis-program

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Status:** The exact Lean 4.30 `Nat.fib` definition and admitted `Nat.fib_add_two` theorem compose into Axeyum's native Nat kernel, where Fibonacci-neighbor coprimality reconstructs twice with an empty footprint and the exact planned dependency set. The imported-to-official route now also has an axiom-free `Nat.gcd_succ`: a target-specific pointwise fuel proof avoids the generic `funext`/`Quot.sound` equation, specializes over the checked target `Nat.mod_lt`, and passes translated-definitional-equality compatibility against the native theorem. With `Nat.dvd_mod_iff`, `Nat.mod_lt`, and `Nat.gcd_succ` as explicit target leaves, native `Nat.dvd_gcd` composes and replays in the official r082 target. The exact r082 Fibonacci theorem remains open; no receipt, evaluation, or ledger credit is due.

**Next:** compose the remaining six planned native gcd/divisibility support theorems over the new official target, then reconstruct the exact r082 `Nat.Coprime (Nat.fib n) (Nat.fib (n + 1))` statement. Keep every support theorem as an explicit compatible empty-footprint target leaf where needed. Do not infer equivalence from names, import quotient assumptions, or issue a semantic receipt before the exact target passes the ordinary kernel.
