# Lane: autogenesis-program

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Status:** ADR-0526 and receipt V4 reconstruct demanded definitions only through ordinary target-kernel admission. The real r082 `Nat.eq_one_of_dvd_one` root now composes exact `Nat.mul`, `Nat.dvd`, the `Exists` package, and eight axiom-free theorems; the larger `Nat.dvd_gcd` control advances to the imported/native `Bool.rec` branch-order mismatch.

**Next:** measure the blast radius of aligning the native Bool package with official Lean's `false`, `true` constructor order, preserve existing kernel computation and theorem inventories, and retry `Nat.dvd_gcd` unchanged. Do not authorize generic recursor permutation or declaration grafting from one mismatch.
