# Lane: autogenesis-program

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Status:** Semantic admission diagnostics now render the expected, inferred, weak-head-normal-form, and first-mismatch expressions before a rejected private target clone is discarded. The unchanged Mathlib 4.30.0 r082 `Nat.dvd_gcd` control isolates official `Nat.mod` versus the native Bool-rollover remainder inside `Nat.div_mod_exec`; its full source closure has 92 declarations. `Nat.mod_lt` already reuses the target theorem, while the independently missing direct consumer is `Nat.dvd_mod_iff`. Fresh official Lean 4.30.0 exports show that both `Nat.dvd_mod_iff` and `Nat.mod_add_div` carry `propext`, so neither proof is admissible support for the axiom-free flywheel.

**Next:** construct an axiom-free target-side `Nat.dvd_mod_iff` proof or bridge over the imported official `Nat.mod` representation; require a fresh-kernel empty footprint; prove that it removes the `Nat.div_mod_exec` dependency from this path; then retry `Nat.dvd_gcd` unchanged. Do not import the assumption-bearing official proofs or weaken definitional equality.
