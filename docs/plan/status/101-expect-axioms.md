# Lane: expect-axioms — a one-directional gate on a two-directional number

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**The axiom ledger now pins all eight prelude groups by value and names the
direction a number moved** (`WIP`, expect-axioms, 2026-08-18). The brief's
premise was mostly already met and one of its numbers was wrong: **28** fact
files (not 58) run `nat_axiom_inventory` in a `checker_command`, and the ledger
has pinned every *default* prelude by value since ADR-0465 — a fall fails that
comparison exactly as a rise does. Converting those 28 would change no bit:
`--require-axiom-free L` pushes `(L, 0)` into the same list `--expect-axioms L=0`
does, and the only preludes any fact names (`nat` 23, `integer` 6, `logic` 2)
already measure 0, the floor.

The real gap was coverage. `creal` (ADR-0468) and `complex` (ADR-0472) were in
**no** measurement the ledger consumed — they need `--include-constructed`, and
the coverage command did not pass it — so their counts could move either way
unobserved; `rat` was measured but missing from `EXPECTED_PRELUDES`. All three
are now in both. A pin for a group the command never builds would pass
vacuously, so dropping the flag is itself a gate failure.

`--check` no longer prints two JSON blobs for the reader to diff. It reports per
prelude, with direction and remedy: a **rise** is a regression (something
previously proved is now assumed), a **fall** is a result the ledger has not
published yet — the direction a blanket axiom-free assertion structurally cannot
see, because it only ever becomes more true. Both fail; re-pinning is one
command. Demonstrated failing on 28 -> 30 and on 32 -> 30 and on a 1 -> 0, then
green.

Profile decided the shape: `--include-constructed` costs **2 m 03 s debug against
10.3 s release**, so the coverage command moved to `--release` — affordable once
in a generator that already runs, not affordable in 28 `checker_command`s.

Guards: `python3 scripts/tests/mutation_controls.py lean-axiom-ledger`, 81 s, 11
mutations, **no survivors**; ten kill exactly one test. The two that do not are
recorded, not smoothed over.

Detail, including a near-miss where the shared worktree briefly measured
`creal: axiom=30` — the whole `Real.*` package — from another lane's in-flight
prelude cache, in [`../notes/101-expect-axioms.md`](../notes/101-expect-axioms.md).

<!-- plan-section: landed-changes -->

| 2026-08-18 | `24578036f` | `gen-lean-axiom-ledger.py`: coverage command gains `--include-constructed` (on `--release`, 12x faster), `EXPECTED_PRELUDES` gains `rat`/`creal`/`complex`, and measurement drift is reported per prelude **with its direction** — REGRESSION / IMPROVEMENT / COVERAGE LOST / ADDED / RESHAPED, each with the re-pin command. Ledger now pins 8 groups by value (was 6); 39 tests (was 24); 11-mutation control registered in `mutation_controls.py`, no survivors. Already wired in both `check.sh` and `just check`, so no new gate divergence. |
