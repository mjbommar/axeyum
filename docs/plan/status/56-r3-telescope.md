# Lane: agent-r3-telescope — the ordered-ring interface's equality slot

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**ADR-0512 phase R3 has landed: the ring interface takes equality as a
parameter, 30 → 39, and instantiating it back at `Eq` reproduces today's
statement node for node (`WIP`, agent-r3-telescope, 2026-08-18).**
`LraReconstructCtx::enable_setoid_equality` declares nine equality-interface
axioms (`eq`, `eq_refl`/`eq_symm`/`eq_trans`, and `add`/`mul`/`neg`/`le`/`lt`
congruence) plus the nine `Eq`-stated `Real` laws **restated through them** —
whose types are computed from the environment by rewriting the partial
application `Eq Real` to `eq`, never written out, so a changed law changes its
restatement rather than silently disagreeing with it. Every equality step in the
LRA/SOS reconstruction then routes through the slot, and
`RingTelescope::SetoidInterface` binds 39. All five fixtures of
`cargo run -q -p axeyum-solver --features full --example ordered_ring_refutation
-- --require-empty`: **39 binders, footprint 0, zero kernel-`Eq` constants left
in the proof term, 30 of 30 non-slot binder types reproduced exactly.**
`farkas_over_the_integers` (9 tests) is untouched — the `Eq` route is the
default and is unchanged.

**Why the five congruences are exactly five is a measurement, not a taste.**
Every `Eq.rec` in the whole arithmetic reconstruction sits inside one of eleven
helpers, and those eleven collapse onto symmetry, transitivity, `add`- and
`mul`-congruence (each left and right), `neg`-congruence, and the `le`/`lt`
casts (each left and right). One-sided congruence is the two-sided law with
`eq_refl` on the argument that does not move, so the two-sided form is what gets
bound. Nothing else in the LRA or SOS routes touches `Eq` at the carrier.

| 2026-08-18 | (pending) | ADR-0512 phase R3: the ordered-ring telescope gains an equality slot (30 → 39 binders) and `specialize_setoid_to_eq` proves it specializes back to today's statement — conclusion **and** all 30 non-slot binder types, node for node. Three mutation kills recorded; `residual_eq_constants` guards the one failure the footprint cannot see. |
