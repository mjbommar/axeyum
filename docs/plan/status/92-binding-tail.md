# Lane: binding-tail — the four verdicts are a partition, and each one can now fail in both directions

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**66 instances were recording the weaker of two true statements, 4 more were
recording nothing at all, and the converse number could not be read** (`WIP`,
binding-tail, 2026-08-18).

Gate line, `python3 scripts/check-lra-hypothesis-binding.py` (~35 s), before →
after:

    instances=135 | structural=95  | anchored=10 | attested=9 | failures=0
    spine_assertions=541 | represented_assertions=296

    instances=135 | structural=102 | structural_anchored=66 | anchored=73
    anchored_nodes=1098 | attested=5 | failures=0
    spine_assertions=541 | represented_assertions=296 | undecomposable_spine=0

**Nothing was weakened to get any of it.** Every number that moved moved because
a check was added or a statement that was already true started being recorded.

**1. The overlap was measured and it is the largest class.** `structural` and
`anchored` answer different questions and the manifests were mutually exclusive
*by construction*, so nobody had ever run both binders over both lists. Doing it:
63 of the 95 `structural` rows also anchor — their query asserts the disequality
outright instead of leaving it a congruence conclusion — and 3 of the 10
`anchored` rows also bind structurally, because `(ite true x y)` is a four-node
term of the file. The dual class is 66, larger than the other three together.

The real change is not the class, it is that **every pin is now two-sided**:

    structural           binds structurally, and does NOT anchor        (32)
    structural-anchored  does BOTH                                      (66)
    anchored             anchors, and does NOT bind structurally         (7)
    attested             does NEITHER                                    (5)

| 2026-08-18 | `c9223e4` | binding: the converse number says which side of the check the missing 245 rows are on — `undecomposable_spine=0` measured and gated, `represented` is a maximum matching rather than an overlap. |
| 2026-08-18 | `b9d2f0a` | binding: the 4 `FiniteArrayExtensionality` rows were never content-free — the emitter collapsed each `(select a i)`; `attested` 9 → 5, `structural` 98 → 102 with 360 new matched term nodes. |
| 2026-08-18 | `a25b18a` | binding: 66 rows were recording the weaker of two true statements — four verdicts become a partition with two-sided pins; `anchored` 10 → 73, `structural_anchored=66` new. |
