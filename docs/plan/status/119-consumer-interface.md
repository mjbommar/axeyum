# Lane: agent-consumer-interface — a command is answered or refused, never dropped

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Gap #3 of the 2026-08-21 capability audit is closed at the command level**
(`WIP`, agent-consumer-interface, 2026-08-21). §6.3 ranked the consumer
interface third by measured cost and called it "the difference between a library
and a solver a stranger can run". Four of its six items were one defect wearing
four hats: **the front door accepted a command and did not answer it.**
`get-model`, `get-value`, `get-unsat-core` and `get-proof` were CLI no-ops with
Rust-API-only counterparts; `set-option` was inert; `set-logic` was stored and
never read.

The half landed earlier — `examples/axeyum_cli.rs`, one verdict per `check-sat` —
made the rest sharper rather than softer. A driver that answers `check-sat` and
drops `(get-model)` produces **no output and no complaint**, and that is
indistinguishable from a solver with no model. It is this repository's own
recurring failure: silence read as a negative result.

Detail moved to [`../notes/119-consumer-interface.md`](../notes/119-consumer-interface.md).

| 2026-08-21 | `b3ef9a965` | The refusal census picked the next thing to build, and it was not what the gap felt like. `(get-model)` declined 66 times over 400 corpus files and **58 were arrays**, against 6 uninterpreted-sort tokens; arrays now render as `(store … ((as const (Array I E)) default) …)` and the same census reads **166 rendered, 9 refused**. Also `DecidedQuery::proof_eligible`: a bounded-string `unsat` the gate did not confirm cannot draw an Alethe proof of the *packed* assertions. That one is defence in depth and says so — over 184 QF_S/QF_SLIA benchmarks, deleting it changes no answer, because the QF_BV emitter declines those shapes. |
| 2026-08-21 | `81361cdd1` | Gap #3's items 2–4. `solve_smtlib_session` answers `get-model`, `get-value`, `get-unsat-core`, `get-proof`, `get-assertions` and `echo` at the command where they stand; `set-option` reports `unsupported` for every option it does not honour; `(set-logic NONSENSE_XYZ)` says `unsupported` and still decides, as z3 does. `solve_smtlib_incremental` became the same walk with the output commands off, so no verdict could move — A/B over all 1,430 tracked `.smt2` at a 10 s budget: 2 differences, both on files that finish in 9.7–11.8 s, both binaries agreeing three of three at 60–120 s. 34 tests; 23 guards deleted one at a time, 22 killed a test and 16 killed exactly one. |
