# Lane: agent-prepush-scope — the kernel step of the pre-push gate

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**The pre-push kernel step ran the real-Lean suites a second time; it no longer
does (`DONE`, agent-prepush-scope, 2026-08-19).** `hooks/pre-push` ran
`cargo test -p axeyum-lean-kernel` wholesale. Fifteen of that crate's 46
integration suites hand modules to a real `lean` and `scripts/check-lean-gate.sh`
already owns them — with a pin, a counted floor and a no-skip rule this step had
none of. Measured warm on s4: **2,296 s → 80 s.**

The deliverable is not the split but the assertion that it is total.
`scripts/check-kernel-suites.sh` DISCOVERS membership (a suite is real-Lean
exactly when it carries `#[path = "support/lean_probe.rs"]`, the same
"membership is the act itself" shape as `check-lean-golden-pins.sh`) and fails if
any `tests/*.rs` is in neither half — so removing duplication cannot silently
create a suite nothing runs. A hand-written list of 31 names would have been a
list someone forgets to extend, failing silently.

**It found one on its first run.** `real_lean_string_monoid_crosscheck` (landed
2026-08-17) invokes a real Lean and was in no gate's table; only the wholesale
`cargo test` ever ran it. It also printed its count as
`AXEYUM-LEAN-CHECKED|string-monoid|1|…` where the gate parses
`AXEYUM-LEAN-CHECKED <tag> checked=<n>` — so it would have summed as zero.
Both fixed; `CHECK_FLOOR` 218 → 219, verified `checked=1` against the pin.

The step is now diff-scoped, and unlike the frontier ratchet's filter this scope
is **derived**: the crate's `Cargo.toml` has one dependency (`num-bigint`) and
nothing from this workspace, so no other crate can move these suites. The
partition assertion runs on either branch — it is what makes the skip safe.

10 guards, 10 controls, each deletion killing **exactly one** control. Needed one
mutation-harness fix: `Unittest.build` ran `py_compile` on every subject, so a
shell subject scored `DID NOT BUILD` on all ten — unmeasurable, in the harness
built to tell that apart. Shell subjects now use `bash -n`.

| 2026-08-19 | `pending` | `scripts/check-kernel-suites.sh`: the kernel's push-time / real-Lean suite partition, discovered from the source and asserted total; `hooks/pre-push` repointed at the non-Lean half (2,296 s → 80 s warm). Found `real_lean_string_monoid_crosscheck` owned by nothing and mis-formatting its check count; floor 218 → 219. |
