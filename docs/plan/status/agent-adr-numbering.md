# Lane: agent-adr-numbering — ADR numbers are a shared append point too

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**`gen-adr-index.py --check-remote` detects an ADR number two checkouts both
claimed, before merge (`DONE`, agent-adr-numbering, 2026-08-18).** `--check`
only ever reads this working tree, so it could not see `origin/main` reusing
0471-0474 (fixed earlier today, `61906c585`/`cd19e54ea`) — and while building
this gate, it found the SAME defect had already recurred: 0468-0470 are ALSO
claimed twice, live, right now. `--check-remote` diffs local `adr-NNNN-*.md`
filenames against `--remote-ref`'s (default `origin/main`) tree via `git
ls-tree`; a number where each side has a file the other lacks is a collision,
reported with the exact files and the next free number.

Deliberate, documented trade: an unresolvable ref (no fetch, no `origin`)
**SKIPs, exit 0** — failing closed would redden every offline lane for a
reason no code fixes. A resolvable-but-stale ref (`.git/FETCH_HEAD` older than
`--max-staleness-hours`, default 24) downgrades a CLEAN result to ADVISORY,
still exit 0 by default (`--require-fresh` makes it exit 1) — a clean verdict
on stale data is confidently wrong, which CLAUDE.md rates worse than no check.
A COLLISION found on stale data is never forgiven by either mode.

Wired last in `just check`'s dependency list and beside `adr-index` in
`check.sh` (see comments at both sites for why "last" matters for `just`
specifically). 6 new guards, each mutation-verified to kill EXACTLY one test
(`python3 scripts/tests/mutation_controls.py adr-index` — all green).

**Left undone, on purpose:** did not renumber the live 0468-0470 collision.
Fixing it means touching ~50 files (facts, plan docs, rustdoc, `.rs` source)
the same way 471-474 was fixed, and several of those files
(`crates/axeyum-solver/src/reconstruct/arithmetic/ordered_ring.rs` and its
tests) had another lane's uncommitted WIP in them at the time — editing them
was off-limits per CLAUDE.md's multi-agent rules. **Consequence: `just check`
and `./scripts/check.sh` are RED on this branch right now**, on the new
`adr-remote-collisions` step, for a real and correctly-reported reason. Detail
and full demo transcripts in
[`../notes/agent-adr-numbering.md`](../notes/agent-adr-numbering.md).

| 2026-08-18 | (pending) | `gen-adr-index.py --check-remote`: cross-checkout ADR-number collision detector, wired into `just check` and `check.sh`; found a second live collision (0468-0470) beyond the one already fixed today (471-474) |
