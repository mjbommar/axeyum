# Lane: math-r3 — what the mathematics is asking for, ranked

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**R3 done; the census is an artifact now, and `17` was not one** (`WIP`,
math-r3, 2026-08-17). The 2026-08-13 misconception audit's `census.tsv` was
never committed, so its headline "17 out of fragment" reached both
[`04`](../../mathematics-2026-08/04-reachability.md) and
[`05`](../../mathematics-2026-08/05-the-mathematics-dag.md) with nothing behind
it. Re-derived against the sibling `math-education` graph at `ce3e2a5`
(unchanged since, so this is not drift): **85 / 16 / 46**, not 86 / 17 / 44.
One of the 17 was a *distractor form inside* a file counted as a separate
corpus row; one genuine out-of-fragment row (`infinity-minus-infinity-is-zero`)
was missing; one (`angle-size-depends-on-arm-length`) reduces to a polynomial
identity and is moved to A, marked CONTESTED rather than asserted. Also: the
graph carries **1,567** concepts, not 1,566 — a locale collation artefact
(`sort -u` folds `C:trend-line` and `C:trendline`; `LC_ALL=C` does not).

**The adversarial corpus ranks something else first.** Censused the graph's 42
`techniques` — proof *shapes*, not propositions: 11 reachable, 19 out of
fragment, 12 heuristics (exactly the 12 the corpus itself marks
`epistemic_status: empirical`). **16 of the 19 want one thing: induction over ℕ
as a discharged schema**, against 7 for limits. Induction is the one entry on
the ranked list that is not a missing logic — the kernel has an inductive `Nat`
with an ι-computing `Nat.rec`, while the curriculum map records the `induction`
node's fragment as `LIA / BV (base + step instances)`: instances, not the
schema. So the largest single item the mathematics asks for is automating an
arrow the flywheel already has, not adding a theory.

**Next.** The obvious slice is the one the ranking names: a goal → induction
schema → reconstructed kernel term route, tested first on the technique rows
that are pure ℕ schemas (`telescoping`, `parity-argument`, `pigeonhole` at
fixed hole count). Second, the census wants a third corpus — its two are both
school-and-olympiad, adversarial along the *shape* axis but not the
*difficulty* axis.

| 2026-08-17 | `f18904db7` | R3: reachability census re-derived and committed as `artifacts/reachability/r3-census.tsv` (190 rows over both corpora); the ranked tables in `04-reachability.md` are now a generated view of it, gated by `scripts/check-reachability-census.py` inside `check-foundational-resources.sh`. 13 guards, each with its own rejection path; mutation-verified that deleting any one kills exactly one test. Corpus coverage checked in both directions and reported SKIPPED, never passed, when the sibling checkout is absent. Stale numbers corrected in `04` and `05`. |
