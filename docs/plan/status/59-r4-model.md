# Lane: agent-r4-model — the constructed reals as a model of the `Real` package

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**ADR-0468 phase R4 has landed: the `Real` axiom package is modelled by the
CONSTRUCTED reals, and ADR-0456's "`Int` is not ℝ" caveat is discharged
(`WIP`, agent-r4-model, 2026-08-18).** `build_creal_model_of_arith` admits one
theorem per law,

```text
Real.CRealModel.<law> : ⟦ type of Real.<law> ⟧ := CReal.<law>
```

with `⟦·⟧` **computed from the axiom as it stands in the environment** —
`arith_model`'s discipline — so an axiom whose statement changes changes the
obligation and an axiom `CReal` does not satisfy makes the build fail rather
than dropping a row. `cargo run -q -p axeyum-lean-kernel --example
creal_model_witness`: **22/22 witnesses footprint-empty, 22/22 syntactically
the `CReal` law up to binder names, 9/22 restated over `CReal.Equiv`, 7/7
discrimination witnesses**, exit 0.

**The interpretation is not a constant renaming, and that is the whole content
of R4.** `Eq` is polymorphic and `CReal.Equiv` is not, so no map from `Eq`
alone is type-correct; what gets replaced is the *partial application*
`Eq Real`, which is exactly R3's `rewrite_eq_at_real` applied to the axioms
instead of to the telescope. The rewrite is **self-guarding**: fail to fire and
the obligation still reads `Eq CReal …` while the proof proves
`CReal.Equiv …`, so the kernel refuses it. Verified — disabling the match makes
`build_creal_model_of_arith` return `DeclarationValueMismatch` and the example
exit 101.

**9 of 22 is now measured three independent ways.** ADR-0468 Measurement 2
counted `Eq` in the axiom types; R3's η-expansion mutation isolated the same
nine as binder-type mismatches; this model reports `restated_over_equiv` from
whether the rewrite fired, and the nine names agree exactly.

Detail moved to [`../notes/59-r4-model.md`](../notes/59-r4-model.md).

| 2026-08-18 | (pending) | ADR-0468 phase R4: `build_creal_model_of_arith` — the `Real` axiom package modelled by the **constructed** reals. 22/22 witnesses axiom-free, 9/22 restated over `CReal.Equiv`, 7/7 discrimination witnesses, exit status depending on all of it (`creal_model_witness`). Four mutation kills; ADR-0456's "`Int` is not ℝ" caveat discharged. |
