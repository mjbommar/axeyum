# Lane: agent-creal-default — `CReal` becomes the carrier the shipped routes use

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**The shipped front-door LRA/SOS reconstruction now runs over the CONSTRUCTED
reals, and a refutation it returns rests on ZERO carrier axioms (`WIP`,
agent-creal-default, 2026-08-18).** `PreludeKey::CReal` puts the construction in
the ADR-0464 template, removing the cost objection: `build_creal_prelude` was
**43.97 s** per call in debug and is now **0.149 s** after the first (294x;
release 4.69 s -> 0.067 s). Then `try_new_over_constructed_reals` — the
`RingSignature`/`EqualitySlot` seam plus `adopt_setoid_equality`, from
`CRealPrelude`'s own theorems at 0 declarations added — becomes what
`ProofFragment::Lra`, `DisjunctiveLra` and `Sos` dispatch to, through one
`lra_ctx()` the classifier and the renderer share.

**Measured through `prove_unsat_to_lean_module` itself**
(`examples/front_door_carrier.rs --require-axiom-free`, whose exit status depends
on the finding). Footprint / of which CARRIER: over `Real` 15/**12**, 22/**17**,
10/**8**; over `CReal` 3/**0**, 5/**0**, 2/**0** — the residue is the query's own
variables and hypotheses. The `Real` column is the in-output control; an empty
one would mean the measurement broke, and the flag fails on it.

**Real Lean accepts it, after a renderer defect the flip exposed.** The first
run failed 5 of 77 `lean_crosscheck` families with `Unknown constant
Int.natAbs`: the renderer ordered an inductive by its own type while writing its
constructors inline, and `Rat.mk` mentions a definition emitted 110 lines later.
Fixed renderer-locally — **not** in `decl_deps`, which `axiom_footprint` shares.
77 of 77 now check, 0 failed. The module declares 3/5/2 axioms against 15/22/10
over `Real`, so Lean's `#print axioms` agrees with the kernel.

**The cost is module size:** 2.4-41 kB to ~2.6 MB (66x-1069x), carrying the
whole constructed N/Z/Q/setoid development.
`nat_axiom_inventory --include-constructed` still reports `real: axiom=30`,
`creal=0`, `complex=0`: the package is unused here, not retired.

<!-- plan-section: landed-changes -->

| 2026-08-18 | (pending) | **`PreludeKey::CReal`, and the shipped LRA/SOS front door moves onto the constructed reals.** `build_creal_prelude` 43.97 s -> **0.149 s** per call (debug; release 4.69 s -> 0.067 s) via the ADR-0464 template. `prove_unsat_to_lean_module` now reconstructs over `CReal` with an adopted equality slot: carrier axioms 12/17/8 -> **0/0/0** on three front-door fixtures, `Real` control non-empty, module axiom lines equal the kernel footprint. Also fixes a module-renderer ordering defect the constructed carrier exposed, which rejected 5 of 77 `lean_crosscheck` families; 77 of 77 now check under lean 4.30.0. Cost: modules 2.4-41 kB -> ~2.6 MB. Every new guard mutation-checked, exactly one test dead each. `nat_axiom_inventory --include-constructed` is now under the prelude-reuse differential gate. |
