# Lane: nat-prime-divisor — Euclid's theorem, ingredient by ingredient

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Both of Euclid's missing ingredients are in; `F:nat-exists-prime-gt` is one
slice from closing** (`WIP`, nat-prime-divisor, 2026-08-17).
`Nat.exists_prime_dvd : ∀ m, 2 ≤ m → ∃ p, (2 ≤ p ∧ ∀ d, d ∣ p → d = 1 ∨ d = p) ∧ p ∣ m`
is admitted axiom-free, recorded as `F:nat-exists-prime-dvd`. It did **not** go
through `lt_well_founded`, which is what the previous lane's note predicted:
strong induction on `m` has to *decide* primality of `m`, and a bounded `∀` is
not decidable constructively without a bounded search anyway — so the search is
done directly, by ordinary `Nat.rec` on the bound, returning the **least**
divisor `≥ 2`. Leastness is what makes primality free; a proper divisor of the
least divisor would be a smaller divisor of `m`. Each step decides `succ j ∣ m`
by reducing `beq (mod m (succ j)) 0`, with the branches separated by the checked
`div_mod_remainder_eq_zero_iff_dvd`. Nothing classical, nothing well-founded.

**A theorem-only slice is kernel-guarded, but its *statement* is not.** No
`Definition` was added, so there is no degenerate computation rule to fear — the
kernel refuses a false theorem and a non-prime witness never gets in. What the
kernel cannot see is a statement weaker than intended. Measured: spelling the
primality bound `1 ≤ p` instead of `2 ≤ p` still type-checks, still admits, and
passes every pre-existing test including axiom-freedom and the determinism
count — and is satisfied by `p = 1`. That mutation was run and killed **exactly
one** test, the new one, which compares the admitted type against an
independently built term. The fact's `kernel-term` checker greps the whole
rendered type for the same reason; a name-only grep survives the mutation.

**Next.** Close `F:nat-exists-prime-gt`. Two small steps remain, both resting
only on already-admitted axiom-free lemmas: (1) `1 ≤ Nat.factorial n` (induction,
`one_le_mul` at the successor), which is what makes `2 ≤ 1 + n!` and so lets
`exists_prime_dvd` apply to it at all; (2) the assembly — take `p` prime with
`p ∣ 1 + n!`; if `p ≤ n` then `dvd_factorial_of_le` gives `p ∣ n!`, `add_comm`
reshapes the sum, `dvd_add_right_cancel_of_pos` yields `p ∣ 1`, and
`not_dvd_one_of_two_le` refutes it; `le_total` then leaves `n ≤ p` and
`lt_or_eq_of_le` sharpens it to `n < p`.

| 2026-08-17 | `d23a9d883` | `Nat.exists_prime_dvd` — every `m ≥ 2` has a prime divisor — admitted axiom-free in a new `nat_prelude::primes` module, with `Nat.le_of_dvd`, `Nat.two_le_succ_or_eq_one` and `Nat.least_divisor_search` beneath it (137 Nat theorems, up from 133). Recorded as `F:nat-exists-prime-dvd`, whose `kernel-term` checker pins the entire rendered type rather than the name — verified against the `1 ≤ p` weakening, which the kernel accepts and a name-only grep would not catch. |
