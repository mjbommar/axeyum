# Lane: int-categoricity — the half of ℤ's universal property that was missing

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**ℤ is now pinned up to bijection, and the limit of that is stated rather than
blurred (`DONE`, agent-int-categoricity, 2026-08-18).** Lane
`agent-characterization` closed ℕ and named its own gap exactly: for ℤ only the
**uniqueness** half of the universal property was proved, so those properties
were proved to *hold* of `Int` and not to *determine* it. `rec_unique` was
uniqueness of a map nobody had constructed.

Built in `crates/axeyum-lean-kernel/src/characterization/int_categoricity.rs`,
declaring into the existing `Int.Characterization` namespace:

| 2026-08-18 | `00f998ccb` | ℤ categoricity: the existence half of the universal property (`iter` + three preservation equations, making `Int` the initial ℤ-structure) and `categorical` — every generated aperiodic ℤ-structure is in structure-preserving bijection with `Int`, universe-polymorphic. `iso` is the constructed two-sided-inverse form, honest about hypothesising the back-map. 32 theorems, all footprints empty; 22 injected weakenings each refused at their own declaration, now bracketed by `reached_declaration` on the near side too. |
| 2026-08-18 | `a2a36590b` | `F:int-categoricity` recorded, and `F:int-characterization`'s "not proved that they determine it" caveat removed because it stopped being true. Every checker anchored on the declaration name AND the empty-footprint column, each run with its subject mangled: 0 on the finding, 1 on the mangle. |
