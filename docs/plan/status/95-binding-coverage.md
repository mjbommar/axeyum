# Lane: binding-coverage — how much of the corpus's Lean evidence says anything

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**The transcription check now covers three routes, and the denominator is
measured rather than estimated** (`WIP`, binding-coverage, 2026-08-18).

Lane `agent-transcription` closed the SMT-LIB → rendered-statement gap
(trust-surface item 3, *weaker than the kernel*) for the two Farkas routes and
declined the rest. This lane widened it and, more usefully, **measured what the
rest actually is**. Swept all **1404** committed `.smt2` files: **270** render a
Lean module at all, and those 270 split exactly three ways.

| verdict | n | what it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **bound** | 125 | every rendered hypothesis bound back to an `(assert …)` line |
| **attested** | 124 | the module transcribes **nothing**; verified content-free |

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-18 by lane `agent-attestation`.** The 124 were not one
> class. Decomposed per route, **89 `ArrayAxiom` modules said nothing because of
> how the emitter was written** — `array_axiom_term_expr` collapsed each whole
> term into a single opaque constant keyed by arena index, though the certificate
> carried the query's own `TermId`s all along, and the trees are 10 nodes at the
> median. A test now pins the defect that hid behind it: read-over-write and
> select-over-ite rendered **the same module, byte for byte**. Six more
> (`QfAbv`/`QfUf`) were structural all along and merely misfiled.
>
> Current gate line: `structural=95 attested=28 attested_vacuous=0`. The
> **self-refuting** instance was a real bug — `conflicting_bool_negation_equalities`
> returned the pair `(p, p)` for `(not (not (= p (not p))))`, a *Boolean*
> conflict where no honest pair exists — and the route now declines it, which
> re-running the search could never have caught. The query is still `unsat` via
> `TermLevelEnum`, `certified=1`.
>
> `structural` is deliberately weaker than `bound`: for 89 of 105 queries no
> assertion says `¬(lhs = rhs)`, because the hypothesis is a congruence
> *conclusion*. Binding those to an assert line would be a check with no true
> instance — so they get their own verdict, and an anti-absorption guard **fails**
> if an instance pinned `attested` can be related to its query, which is exactly
> the silent lie that had already happened to those six.
| **declined** | 21 | neither — named, not pinned, not checked |
