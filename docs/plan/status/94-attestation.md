# Lane: attestation — can the content-free routes transcribe, and do they now

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Yes, for 95 of the 124 — it was how the emitter was written, and both the
emitter and a checker that can fail have landed** (`WIP`, attestation,
2026-08-18).

Lane `agent-binding-coverage` measured that 124 of the corpus's 270 rendered
Lean modules transcribe nothing: their entire vocabulary is
`α atom._N func._N Eq.{1} Not And`, a fresh vocabulary with no declared
relationship to any query symbol. It was right not to "cover" them. The
question this lane took is the next one: **is that abstraction necessary, or is
it how the emitter was written?** Measured per route, it is both, and the split
is sharp.

| n | route | why the module said nothing | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 89 | `ArrayAxiom` | the emitter collapsed each whole term into ONE opaque constant | **structural**, checked |
| 6 | `QfAbv`, `QfUf` | nothing — they were structural all along, and were misfiled | **structural**, checked |
| 13 | `ArrayAxiom`, `TermIdentity` | both sides genuinely are bare query leaves | attested |
| 9 | `Sos` | the real reconstructor declined and a `prop._0` wrapper fired | attested |
| 4 | `FiniteArrayExtensionality` | the same nothing, under a conjunction | attested |
| 2 | `ArrayAxiom` | the rendered term is the output of a **rewrite** | attested |
| 1 | `ArrayAxiom` | *self-refuting* — its `False` needed no hypothesis | **declines** |

| 2026-08-18 | `3076b6ae0` | the one Lean module `rfl` refuted on its own: root-caused to a degenerate `(t, t)` witness, the route now declines, and a self-refuting attestation FAILS the run instead of being counted |
| 2026-08-18 | `8e4894de4` | `ArrayAxiom` renders the query's own terms; a third `structural` verdict binds 95 modules to their query's subterms, 359 of 372 corruptions caught, and the attested class drops 124 → 28 with an anti-absorption guard |
