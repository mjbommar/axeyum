# Lane: solver-arith-group — D3 intra-crate grouping of `axeyum-solver`

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**D3 grouping is BLOCKED, not queued (`BLOCKED`, solver-arith-group,
2026-08-17).** Sent to execute the one D3 group the 2026-08-17 edge measurement
supported (arithmetic; the other three were refuted). Re-measured first, and did
not move any files — two reasons, both in
[`03-solver-decomposition.md`](../../refactor-2026-08/03-solver-decomposition.md)
under "Measured 2026-08-17 (second pass)".

1. The first pass committed no script, so its membership rule is unrecoverable
   and its arithmetic verdict does not survive re-derivation: sweeping plausible
   boundaries moves the degree-matched p from <0.0001 (23 modules) to 0.377 (39),
   crossing out of significance **at the 34–35 modules the first pass itself
   reported** (p = 0.110). Only the `strings` row reproduces exactly, because
   zero internal edges pins the set.
2. The move fails the gate for every membership. A directory is *one* node in
   `analyze_solver_module_graph.py`, so grouping merges nodes and creates cycles
   no member had. Best case (23-module core): `mbp` newly enters the theory
   core's cycle and the largest cycle grows **58,215 → 103,514 lines**, 25.8% →
   45.8% of the crate, while its module count moves 24 → 25. Every wider
   membership also adds `arith -> reconstruct`, destroying D1's precondition.

Landed the measurement as code instead — `scripts/analyze_solver_group_collapse.py`,
exit status is the finding — so the next lane decides this before moving a file
rather than after.

**Next:** not this. The blocker is the arithmetic ↔ `auto` / `reconstruct`
cycle; D3's sequencing item 3 now depends on item 4 (`D1` narrowing), not the
other way round. Whoever takes that: run
`scripts/analyze_solver_group_collapse.py --group arith-core --check` and watch
it go green — that is the exit criterion, and it is currently red.
