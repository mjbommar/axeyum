# Lane: agent-creal-inv — the multiplicative inverse over the constructed ℝ

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**ADR-0487: `CReal.inv` is BUILT, and `x⁻¹` denotes one real rather than one
per modulus (`WIP`, agent-creal-inv, 2026-08-18).**
`CReal.inv : (x : CReal) → (k : Nat) → PosBound x k → CReal` — a function may
*take* a `Prop` and return a `Type`, it may only not *branch* on one, so the
**modulus** is the thing that must be data and the proof is only a proof. With
it `mul_inv_cancel` (`x · x⁻¹ ≈ 1` on the positive branch), `inv_congr` — which
quantifies over **two independent moduli**, because two callers with different
`k` for the same `x` build different sequences — and `inv_index_irrelevant`.
Congruence is *uniqueness of inverses in a commutative monoid*, not a second
estimate. **76 `CReal` declarations, trusted surface still 0**; `nat_index_symm`
is the fifth time `Rat.natDivSucc` has been kept off the antitone path. Design,
measurements and what is deliberately absent (the negative branch, `abs`,
cotransitivity): [`../notes/creal-inv.md`](../notes/creal-inv.md).

| 2026-08-18 | `57af69142` | **`CReal.inv` is built**, with `mul_inv_cancel`, `inv_congr` and `inv_index_irrelevant`, all footprint-free and accepted on FIRST submission. Index `(C+1)n + C`, `C+1 = (4k+4)(k+2)`, read back *two* ways so `natDivSucc` still need not be antitone. Non-vacuity is admitted **through the kernel** (`PosBound one 0`), and `∀h, ¬(1⁻¹ ≈ 0)` follows from `mul_inv_cancel` alone, so the operation is neither vacuous nor the zero function. Negative controls: `x·x⁻¹ ≈ 0` and `x⁻¹ ≈ x` both REFUSED. |
| 2026-08-18 | `facde4243` | The two ℕ/ℚ lemmas the index arithmetic is written in. `Rat.inv_natDivSucc : (1/(m+1))⁻¹ = (m+1)/1` — the only place the *value* of an inverse is computed, and needed because every bound over ℝ is one `natDivSucc` with a `Nat` numerator. `Rat.nat_index_symm : (a+1)b + a = (b+1)a + b` — **Bishop's sampling index is symmetric in shift and argument**, which is how a bound read at a product index comes back to the *shift* rather than to `n`. |
