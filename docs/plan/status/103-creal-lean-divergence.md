# Lane: creal-lean-divergence — which Lean rejected it

<!-- plan-section: lane-status -->

**Lean's kernel accepts all 470 declarations of the constructed-real carrier;
it is Lean's ELABORATOR that refuses four** (`WIP`, creal-lean-divergence,
2026-08-18). The handover said our kernel admits what Lean's kernel rejects. It
does not. `scripts/lean/replay-lean4export.lean` drives
`Environment.addDeclCore` from our NDJSON — Lean's kernel, from
`mkEmptyEnvironment` — and over the **whole** carrier reports `environment now
holds 470 constants` in **1.4 s**. Tampering `CReal.Equiv.not_zero_one`'s proof
makes the same binary reject it naming `Not (CReal.Equiv (CReal.ofRat Rat.zero)
(CReal.ofRat Rat.one))`, so it checked *that* declaration against *that* type.

**The mechanism, isolated to one token per line.** Lean's elaborator does not
unfold a `theorem` while reducing; its kernel does. Re-spell every `theorem` in
the *same emitted file* as `def` — nothing else changed — and the elaborator
accepts it: the `not_zero_one` module (695,655 B) in 5.0 s and the **whole
carrier** (2,541,928 B) in 27.9 s, against 4 refusals as emitted (two, plus two
`unknown constant` cascades).
`Nat.gcd`'s descent is justified by the *theorem* `Nat.mod_lt`, so `gcd 0 3` is
accepted and every recursive `gcd` refused, while `Nat.mod/div/sub` and a bare
`WellFounded.fix` reduce fine. Not the sharing pass (hand-inlined: identical
refusal), not a budget. `internal exception #3` is the command abort.

**The coverage hole is closed.** Emission was reachability-driven, so Lean saw
only the reachable slice (343 of 465 when ADR-0511's lane measured it).
`real_lean_creal_carrier_kernel_replay` exports the complete environment and
requires Lean's constant count to **equal** our kernel's, so "accepted" cannot
mean "accepted a subset"; `real_lean_wellfounded_elaborator_divergence` pins the
residue. Gate **20 suites, floor 212 -> 218**; measured `declared=470
lean_kernel_constants=470`, `checked=2`/`checked=4`. Mutations bite: dropping
one theorem record kills the carrier suite on the COUNT alone (469 vs 470, Lean
still accepting); a no-op `theorems_as_defs` kills the divergence suite on the
`def` row alone; each left the other green. The fix (`theorem` -> `def` in the
renderer) is measured and handed to the renderer's owner, not taken here.

<!-- plan-section: landed-changes -->

| 2026-08-18 | `PENDING` | Lean has two checkers (ADR-0517): the kernel accepts all 470 carrier declarations, the elaborator refuses those whose checking must reduce a `theorem`. `real_lean_creal_carrier_kernel_replay` (whole carrier, no reachability filter, count-equality + tamper control) and `real_lean_wellfounded_elaborator_divergence` (`gcd` refused / `mod` accepted / same module with `theorem`->`def` accepted / kernel takes both); gate floor 212 -> 218. |
