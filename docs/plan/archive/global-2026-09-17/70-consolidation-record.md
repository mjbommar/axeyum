## Consolidation record

The 2026-08-05 consolidation removed two conflicting append-only root journals
and one subsidiary live tracker from active use. It corrected these stale
claims:

- CAS wave 24 was described as unpushed and unintegrated; its code and pause
  commits are both ancestors of current main.
- An August 1 shell-failure resume block remained active after later green CI
  and clean parity reruns.
- The reality summary still said seven measured parity divisions after the
  ledger reached eleven.
- The exploration tracker called T3.5 next while its own G1 gate blocked all of
  phase 3.
- Repository instructions disagreed about whether `PLAN.md` or `STATUS.md` was
  the mutable source.

The containing commit establishes this file as the only current project-level
authority. Historical claims remain reviewable through Git and the dated result
notes they cite.
